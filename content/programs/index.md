# Sewing Project
## Continuing education for girls - Malawi
If you educate a man, you educate an individual. But if you educate a woman, you educate a nation.
“There is no greater pillar of stability than strong, free and educated woman”. There should not be any
barrier that differentiates one child from other because of gender. Even after their puberty, Every girl
child should have access to school , yet many girls are prevented from doing so because of a natural
biological process. To solve this problem, we are trying to supply reusable sanitary pads which will
enable them to continue their education. In the past, we’ve held workshops where we’ve supplied
sewing machines to local women and they can make sanitary pads and give them to girls..
