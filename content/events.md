# August 6th 2022: Yard Sale Fundraiser

Goal of our *Yard Sale Fundraiser* at
 [355 North Emerson Rd](https://goo.gl/maps/yRq3AK71KgVfy97x6) from
 11AM - 2PPM is to help the girls of Malawi. All the proceeds will be used to
 make reusable sanitary pads for the girls of Malawi. This effort is managed
 by [Gloria Matekenya](mailto:gloria@daaya.org). 

 This is going to be FUN Yard Sale Fundraiser! Non-alcoholic drinks and snacks
 will be provided at the location. There are various categories of items for
 sale at the yard sale: *Books, Home Decor, Kitchen Utilities, Toys, Indian Clothing, Jewelry and Amazing Arts from local artists.*

 Your presence and any small contribution will make a big difference in the lives of the Girls!




### Update
 We were able to execute our first "Yardsale Fundraiser" and were able to raise a good amount of funds which will benefit the girls in Malawi in a greater capacity. A huge shout out to the high schoolers for pulling off this event. We thank the community for their support..
