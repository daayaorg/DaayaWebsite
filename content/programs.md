Knowledge has medicinal properties for ailments of mind. Books, experiences, interactions are the ingredients. In our continued efforts to spread knowledge, we were able to conduct our workshop "KUONGOLA INITIATIVE: GIRLS LIBRARY CAMP". Our aim was to create awareness among girls about puberty & menstrual health. We were able to brought in some local Women Entrepreneurs. They shared their experiences with hardship, hard work and success  A huge shout out Gloria Matekenya for pulling this through.
