# Kuongola Library Initiative
Knowledge has medicinal properties for ailments of mind. Books, experiences, interactions are the ingredients. In our continued efforts to spread knowledge, we were able to conduct our workshop "KUONGOLA INITIATIVE: GIRLS LIBRARY CAMP". Our aim was to create awareness among girls about puberty & menstrual health. We were able to brought in some local Women Entrepreneurs. They shared their experiences with hardship, hard work and success  A huge shout out Gloria Matekenya for pulling this through.
