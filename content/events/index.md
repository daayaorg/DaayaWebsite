# Success Stories
#### August 2022: Yard Sale Fundraiser
We were able to execute our first "Yardsale Fundraiser" and were able to raise a good amount of funds which will benefit the girls in Malawi in a greater capacity. A huge shout out to the high schoolers for pulling off this event. We thank the community for their support..
